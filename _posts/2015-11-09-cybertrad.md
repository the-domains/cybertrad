description: 'CyberTrad is a musical experiment that combines melodic sensibilities from traditional Irish and Breton music, and blends them with rhythmic elements of contemporary Quebecois, funk, and Hip Hop. The project features Matthew Olwell on flute, vocals, and percussion, Dominic “Shodekeh” Talifero on human Beatbox, and Aimee Curl on upright bass and vocals. Original compositions and arrangements by Matthew Olwell make CyberTrad both familiar and intriguing. '
