... what is it? 

A musical experiment that combines
melodic sensibilities from traditional Irish and Breton music, and blends them
with rhythmic elements of contemporary Quebecois, funk, and Hip Hop. The
project features Matthew Olwell on flute, vocals, and percussion, Dominic
"Shodekeh" Talifero on human Beatbox, Simon Lapage on electric bass, and Aimee Curl on vocals. Original compositions and arrangements by Matthew Olwell make CyberTrad
both familiar and intriguing.
